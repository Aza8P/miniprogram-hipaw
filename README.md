HiPaw is WeChat Mini-Program. It was built to provide an online presence for rescued pets in China and support the rescue groups in finding the forever home for the pets. 
We designed and gamified the journey so that the users can effortlessly create pet adoption and adoption event posts, filter with key information such as location, age, gender and book meet-ups.
